# terminal-art

Living, animated art pieces for your terminal. Pure Python standard library — no dependencies, truecolor, adapts to your terminal size in real time.

## Pieces

### `plasma.py`
A morphing truecolor plasma field built from layered sine waves, cycling through an HSV color wheel with brightness driving an ASCII intensity ramp.

```bash
python3 plasma.py
```

Quit with `Ctrl-C` (uses the alternate screen buffer, so it leaves your scrollback clean).

**Tunable knobs** at the top of the file:

| Knob | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `FLOW_SPEED` | how fast the plasma churns |
| `PALETTE_SPEED` | how fast the colors cycle |
| `FPS` | frame rate / smoothness |
| `CHARS` | the character intensity ramp (try `" ░▒▓█"` for a blockier look) |

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- A terminal with 24-bit (truecolor) support — iTerm2 and modern macOS Terminal both work.
